### About The Project

Classification or grouping is very important in a statistical study and helps to make the study easier. one of those grouping method is Clustering. Basically, a cluster is a group of individuals or objects that share a characteristic. its easy to analyse data after clustering. But clustering large amounts of data using human labor is still a very less effective process. We see that as a problem with this process. Therefore, it will be more effective if the data can be entered into a computer in an easy way and clustered by the computer to get the required output. Therefore, it is very important to design a computer program that can perform the clustering. particularly in this project, identification of problems arising in the implementation of the clustering method, Finding solutions to the identified problems and finding ways to apply
them, Prepare a program using Matlab to solve the problems using the solutions found in this way were the Objectives. MATLAB is a advanced and effective computer program used to program mathematical concepts. The problem described above can be avoided if a program is developed for this requirement using the Matlab program. In this project Euclidean Distances were used to Cluster Data. Hierarchical clustering method under cluster analysis was used here.In this method, the data is arranged according to a certain level of importance. also we were able to add 6 methods of clustering into this Program.

###  Cluster Analysis
he term ”cluster analysis” is a catch-all term for a broad range of statistical techniques that all seek to identify clusters, or groups of objects, in a sample of objects.
Contrary to discriminant analysis, a group structure need not be known a prior in
cluster analysis, which is crucial.

###  A Cluster
Basically, a cluster is a group of individuals or objects that share a characteristic.
Cluster is described as a collection of items with comparable traits and properties in
statistics and data science. Numerous fields employ these clusters. Machine learning
and big data analysis are two of them.



### How to Run

For Windows / Linux Systems,
 
1. Enter Your data into *input.xlsx* file. 
2. Place both *Final_Code.m* and *input.xlsx* in same Folder.
3. Run the *Final_code.m* using MATLAB (2020<version).
4. Simply Follow Instructions Provided by the Program.
5. Reults will be automatically saved in *Output_Table(..)_...xlsx* and *Output_Dendrogram(..)_...png* files inside the same folder.
